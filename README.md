This is a small project to use python and open cv to create/test deep learning/neural network options. Current goal is to recgnize face from any given image

# Some extras!
currently added:
  - Motion detection
  - Object distance mapping
  - Posting messages on a remote API service
  - Node + Express to capture python post request data



### How to use:
Very Simple. Assuming you have Python 3.6+ and open cv installed
```sh
$ python moduleName.py
```
If you have multiple version of python [ex: on a Ubuntu system]
```sh
$ python3 moduleName.py
```

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Future:
Provide your comments or feedback. We will try to improve as its a learning and work in progress project. Let us know if you want to contribute in Code.
